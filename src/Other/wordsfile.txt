At the time of its construction in 1892, this facility was named com.solvd.bankclasses.MainOLD Building. In 2002, it was renamed the
"Silver Center of Arts & Science" in honor of Julius Silver, an alumnus of the College of Arts & Science,
who bequeathed $150 million to the college. Renovations have dramatically improved the facility while maintaining
the building's many historic features. com.solvd.bankclasses.MainOLD Building previously served as the home of NYU's Washington Square
College until all undergraduate liberal arts education was consolidated at the Washington Square in 1973 after
the sale of the University Heights campus in the Bronx.

The current building was designed by Alfred Zucker, a German born and trained architect, in 1892.
It replaced architects' Town, Davis & Dakin's original Gothic Revival structure from 1835. Zucker
maintained the foundation and many com.solvd.bankclasses.other features of the original university building but not the
Gothic facade, partially for sake of historic continuity. Today, NYU owns nine com.solvd.bankclasses.other buildings
designed by Zucker that were built in this formerly commercial area, as lofts and wholesale stores.
The Brown Building of Science (formerly the Asch Building) and the Waverly Building occupy the same
block as the Silver Center. The Brown Building was the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire,
which generated many of New York City's current labor laws. The three buildings are internally connected
at the ground floor as well as by stairway and elevator (with the idiosyncrasy of adjacent floors that
do not correspond by floor number.) The three buildings are known are the "com.solvd.bankclasses.MainOLD block."
